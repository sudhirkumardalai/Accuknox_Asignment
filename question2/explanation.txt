Step1:  Create a simple model.
Step-2: create a view that saves the model and triggers the signal.
Step-3: Signal triggered after server runs.
 Output:

[02/Oct/2024 02:13:06] "GET /chat/ HTTP/1.1" 404 2418
Signal received in thread: Thread-3 (process_request_thread)  this output comes in the terminal.
This confirms that the signal handler (my_handler) runs in the same thread as the caller (create_model).
The name of the thread printed by the signal handler will match the thread in which the HTTP request is processed,
demonstrating that Django signals operate synchronously with the caller's thread.
