To demonstrate that Django signals run inside the same database transaction as the caller. We have to follow few steps-

Step-1: First we have to create a Book model as an example.
Step-2:  The signal_update_title() function in the code is connected to the post_save signal, 
         and it modifies the title immediately after a book is saved.This demonstrates that code inside the transaction runs before commit,
         while the code in on_commit() runs only after a successful commit.

Step-3: We force a rollback by raising an exception inside the transaction block. 
        Both the signal's changes and the transaction will be rolled back.
Step-4: The signal modifies the title during the transaction, 
        while transaction.on_commit() schedules code that would execute only after a successful commit.

This approach further demonstrates that Django signals run inside the same database transaction as the caller.
